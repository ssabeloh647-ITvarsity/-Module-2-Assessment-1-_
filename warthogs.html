            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
            
            <p>Warthogs may not be the most beautiful or graceful creatures in the Animal Kingdom. But they are remarkable for their strength, intelligence, and flexibility! Unlike many of their African counterparts, they are not endangered. This is because they are so skilled at adapting to new threats. For example, most warthogs like to forage during the light of the morning and early evening. But if they live in an area where people hunt them, they switch to foraging at night.</p>

            <p>Lions, cheetahs, leopards, painted dogs, hyenas, and eagles all like to snack on a warthog when they get a chance. Warthogs have longer legs than other swine. This allows them to run away from these potential predators, reaching speeds of up to 34 miles (55 kilometers) per hour. When humans get out of bed, they often stumble along, rubbing their eyes to wake up. Warthogs donâ€™t have the luxury of waking up slowly. When they leave their burrow, they must dash out at top speed in case any predators are waiting for them!</p>

            <p>It's not easy to catch them. Besides being good at dodging and running, warthogs are not afraid to fight. They use their sharp lower canine teeth (which look like straight tusks) as weapons while squealing at the top of their lungs! When they walk, their tail hangs down, but when they run, their tail sticks up, with the bushy tip hanging down. This may serve as a warning to other warthogs if danger is near.</p>
            


            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You will find the Warthogs at pen E17, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
