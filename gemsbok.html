            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
            
            <p>Oryx are distinctive antelope with long, straight, slender horns. These horns, carried by both males and females, give oryx the nickname spear antelope. The horns of the scimitar-horned oryx are a bit different. This species gets its common name from the shape of its hornsâ€”long and curved like Arabian swords called scimitars. In all six oryx species, the horns of the females are longer than those of the males.</p>

            <p>Oryx are often called gemsbok (pronounced JEMS baak) in Africa. But in Germany, gemsbok is the common name for the chamois, a type of goat-antelope! Having a scientific name as well as a common name helps people around the world know which animal they're talking about.</p>

            <p>Oryx range in color from whitish to light brown or gray, depending on the species. They have much darker hair on the legs and in a stripe along the belly and back. Fringe-eared oryx also have black tufts of hair on their ear tips.</p>
            
            <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
            
            <p>You will find the Gemsboks at pen E10, right next to the Amphitheatre</p>
